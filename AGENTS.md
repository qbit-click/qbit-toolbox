## Qbit AI tooling

This managed block describes repository-owned AI tooling installed by `qbit-toolkit`. Existing project instructions outside this block remain authoritative for architecture, build/test commands, coding conventions, and contribution rules.

### Mandatory task classification

Before selecting an AI capability, classify the request as ordinary repository work, semantic code work, architecture-impact analysis, external-library documentation, or real incident analysis.

### Deterministic tool routing

- Use built-in file/command/Git tools for ordinary repository work.
- Use Serena only when semantic symbol/reference/diagnostic behavior is materially useful. Start with a read-only semantic call.
- Use Graphify only for explicit broad architecture-impact work and only through the scoped `.ai/scripts/graphify-*` wrappers. Always validate material graph conclusions against source and, where useful, Serena.
- Use Context7 only for narrow external version-specific documentation after resolving the dependency/version from project metadata.
- Use Sentry only for a concrete incident and only through the configured read-only tools.
- Browser/Playwright tooling is intentionally absent unless the project establishes a separate justified capability.

### Execution timing and reuse

- Local tooling is container-owned; do not install Serena, Graphify, language servers, or Rust components globally on the host.
- Serena starts lazily through project-scoped MCP configuration; first use may build the pinned image.
- Graphify requires an explicit repository-relative scope. The build wrapper reuses an unchanged scope fingerprint; the update wrapper forces a rebuild.
- Full Doctor is for installation, maintenance, tooling/version changes, or real inconsistency, not every prompt.
- Bootstrap and Doctor must not install target application dependencies or run target-root package-manager/Cargo operations.
- Follow `.ai/policies/tool-boundaries.md` for trust, mutation, network, and evidence boundaries.

## AI context lifecycle

- Before the first substantive repository analysis, planning, or implementation in a Codex session, automatically start AI context with the repository-owned launcher for the active host: on Windows run `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .ai/context/context.ps1 start`; on Linux/macOS run `bash .ai/context/context.sh start`. Do not ask the developer and do not wait for a context-loading instruction.
- Read `.ai-bridge/context-runtime.md` before substantive planning or implementation. Treat its active workstream, execution cursor, unresolved work items, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and validation freshness as the continuity resume contract. Do not replace that structured state with a shorter free-form summary.
- Do not rerun `start` repeatedly in the same session unless the context cache may have changed materially. If runtime validation evidence is stale for the current worktree, do not rely on it as current validation; rerun the required gate before claiming validation.
- Central AI context is coordination evidence, never implementation authority. Current source, tests, schemas/migrations, explicit contracts, and committed canonical decisions outrank stored context according to their claim type.
- Preserve pre-existing uncommitted user changes; do not stage, format, rewrite, reset, clean, or otherwise disturb unrelated work.
- After a substantive validated milestone that materially changes durable continuity state, and before the final handoff, automatically write `.ai-bridge/context-checkpoint.json` and run the platform-appropriate checkpoint launcher: on Windows `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .ai/context/context.ps1 checkpoint`; on Linux/macOS `bash .ai/context/context.sh checkpoint`. No developer reminder is required.
- Do not create checkpoints for ordinary read-only questions, every chat message, or work that produced no durable continuity change.
- New substantive checkpoints must use `schemaVersion: 2`, repository `qbit-toolbox`, and include `scope`, controlled `status`, `objective`, `confirmedFindings[]`, `decisions[]`, `rejectedApproaches[]`, `validation[]`, `openQuestions[]`, `nextAction`, plus `continuity.mode`, `continuity.workstream`, and `continuity.validationLedger[]`. `schemaVersion: 1` is legacy-read compatibility only.
- Use `continuity.mode: tracked` whenever work remains active, pending, blocked, or otherwise resumable. Carry every existing work item forward by stable ID, preserve dependencies/blockers/acceptance criteria/validation requirements, and set the execution cursor to the exact current item and exact next action. Never silently drop an unresolved item or switch workstream IDs to make a checkpoint pass.
- Use `continuity.mode: snapshot` only when there is no unresolved tracked workstream. Terminal workstreams must explicitly close/cancel/supersede every work item and clear `cursor.currentItemId`; the lifecycle will archive the workstream rather than discard it.
- Add structured validation ledger entries only for validation actually executed for this repository/worktree. Validation IDs are immutable; use a new stable ID for each new validation event.
- Use `export`, `import`, and `reconnect` only for deliberate offline or cross-machine continuity transfer. After an imported offline session advances context locally, use `reconnect` when the configured remote is reachable; never bypass a reconnect divergence by reset, rebase, merge, or force-push.
- Promote durable technical decisions into their canonical owning repository/ADR/contract; the context checkpoint records continuity, not technical authority.
- Never store secrets, credentials, cookies, tokens, private keys, `.env` values, customer secrets, or raw chat transcripts in AI context.
- If context start/checkpoint fails because of missing context source, authentication, dirty/diverged context state, continuity loss prevention, invalid transition, or a concurrent conflict, do not perform destructive recovery; report the condition and preserve data.
- `.ai-bridge/` and `.ai/context/cache/` are transient/ignored runtime locations. Semantic indexes and graph outputs remain derived evidence tools, not project memory.
